Objects
    * Constructors
        *"New" is a Constructors
        * another contsrructor is "Object.create" because it creates a new object with the prototype set to a certain object
        * a prototype is an object that is used as a fallback source of properties
        * you need a fallback source of properties because if you try to access a property that doesn't exist on an object, it will look for it on the prototype'
        * in essense, a prototype is a way to share properties between objects and provide redundency?
    * Prototype-Based Inheritance
    * Prototype based Inheritance is a way to share properties between objects
       * You want to share properties because it allows you to avoid repeating yourself, and in the long run
       * it makes your code easier to maintain, and allows you to code faster and more coherantly
    * Shared Properties
        * Shared properties are properties that are shared between objects
        * you need shared properties because it allows you to avoid repeating yourself, ineheritance being your shortcuts
        * this principle should be used when designing your code prior to attempting to assemble.
        * having a strong sense of what particular objects offer will ease the design.  Mental Model building, mental legos
    * "New" is a Constructor, a Constructor is a function, a method is a function attached to an object.
    * Based on this principle, you can organize the specific syntax of your code in your head to know where it logically
    * belongs.  This is a mental model, a mental map of your code.
    * another exmple of a Constructor is "Math.random" because it creates a random number, or
    * 
     
    * in Javascript "if" is a statement, a statement is a command that performs an action. do "x" while "y" is "z" where x is
    * the action, y is the condition, and z is the result of the conditions is true or false.

    * Yearly ECMA standards are released in June, and are named after the year they are released.  For example, ECMA 2015
    * check standards in June
While "strawmen" arguments are considered logical fallacies, they are also a way to test the validity of an argument.
    * in this way, they can be used to test the validity of an argument, and to see if it holds up to scrutiny.  The point of
    * a  straw man is practice, but you have to hold your doubt very firmly and be aware of your biases.  You know it
    * is generally not right enough, but it simplifies the concept so you can start. demonstrated functionality is how you 
    * move forward.  Polish polish polish; pay attention to the sticky parts .  This is likeley a issue with your mental
    * model and means it needs strengthening your connection to it, or you have an assumption that is square pegging
    * the round hole.

The ECMA standards follow this format  0 - strawman, 1 - proposal, 2 - draft, 3 - candidate, 4 - finished.  Do not be
    affraid to go back, as your skills grow more robust on the more complete versions of your proposal, you'll need
    to return to the strawman to see if you can come up with a more useful solution that better fits your needs.
    This cycle will never end as you develop, largely because the world doesn't sit still.  Its the reason for the
    yearly release
